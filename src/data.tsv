# Each line is one apex domain, a single tab, a destination url with protocol and path, and a return.
# Any line without exactly one tab in it is ignored, like these comments.
# for example (this example has extra tabs, so won't generate a redirection):
	#	custom-domain.com	https://www.destination.com/path/to/resource?campaign=test
# This line, however, will generate a redirection, with exactly one tab between an apex domain and a destination url.
